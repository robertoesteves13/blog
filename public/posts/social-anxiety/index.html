    </header><p>My mental health have been deteriorating over these months and I&rsquo;m worried that
it&rsquo;s getting worse. I can&rsquo;t help but observe the absurds I see during my day and
how radicalized the world have become. I genuenily fear those people that mock
others because their views and beliefs are different than theirs, going as far
as gaslighting the person entirely. I&rsquo;m no innocent for doing that at some point
of my life, but I try to redeem myself and start to have a better construction
of words where someone don&rsquo;t be harrased by me and have a more civil discussion
about important things that are generally disregarded because it doesn&rsquo;t match
their views.</p>
<p>For those super skeptical people that might think I may be on a extremist group
of some kind, I want to warn that <strong>I&rsquo;m only speaking on behalf of myself, and not
for some group of any kind.</strong></p>
<h1 id="everyone-needs-help-not-just-a-selective-minority-group-of-people">Everyone needs help, not just a selective &ldquo;minority&rdquo; group of people.</h1>
<p>That&rsquo;s important to say it out loud, because some people just don&rsquo;t get that
everyone have problems in their lives. Just because someone is a &ldquo;cisgendered
white male&rdquo;, doesn&rsquo;t mean that he can&rsquo;t have any form of physical or emotional
support. Judging a person solely because of their appearence is just wrong, and
it creates a flammable debate about <em>why group X is the root of all evil in this
world</em> that in turn radicalize individuals and distance them from each other.</p>
<p>For me, despite being considered a &ldquo;cinsgendered white male&rdquo;, I still have my
struggles. I have severe ADHD that makes learning very hard for me. Paying attention
for a consecutive amount of time is hard and any distractions makes me deviate from
what I need to do for hours. I&rsquo;ve been learning how to better control it since
the pandemic, but sometimes I can&rsquo;t just help myself. I really try, but it&rsquo;s just
not enough.</p>
<p>Despite all my struggles, I&rsquo;m happy on what I achieved to learn about programming
and computer science in general. I really love computers and I try to push it for
being my source of living in the future. I&rsquo;m also grateful for having proper conditions
to live a life with dignity and so much more.</p>
<h2 id="but-i-cant-feel-any-good">But I can&rsquo;t feel any good</h2>
<p>I still feel my life is miserable. I can&rsquo;t see myself on the goals I try to push
and say for my friends and family. I can&rsquo;t feel joy for doing things that I would
enjoy months ago. My only desire I have after work is going to bed and try to sleep,
but failing miserably because I still keep using my cellphone. I would even skip
some classes at college for that. I would even try to oversleep to not go at work,
but I know I&rsquo;m needed there and also I need to do something at least productive.</p>
<h2 id="my-plans-doesnt-go-as-expected">My plans doesn&rsquo;t go as expected</h2>
<p>I planned from moving to another place have been delayed because of college, which
seems fine at the start but I can&rsquo;t see any importance of it anymore. My class has
a lot of people that brings unorder and chaos. They don&rsquo;t care about learning and
the content, but about partying and using drugs, just like any university student
nowadays. Having a 18-22 year gap from others is a lot for zoomers, like I can&rsquo;t
even understand some of the things they&rsquo;re taking about. They seem to care more
about their social media life than real life itself. I don&rsquo;t want to be friends
to this kind of people, they care more about the physical part of life too much,
where I try to balance between the physical and spiritual/emotional parts.</p>
<h2 id="im-burned-out">I&rsquo;m burned out</h2>
<p>I can&rsquo;t live my life like this anymore. I want a break from everything. I want to
rest for whatever amount of time I need to return with sanity. I want to feel joy
again like I have been feeling in the past months. <strong>I can&rsquo;t stay here doing nothing
to make my life a bit better and rot for years.</strong></p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m also tired of trying. My persistance seems to have come to an end, for now, but it
also might be just a need to cool my mind off for some time. Still, I feel like I suck,
and those that attack people just by their appearence or believes affect me a lot.</p>
<p>I want to believe in a world where I might be able to make a difference and also
a better place for everyone, but this agressive and radical dialogue about the
opressor and the opressed makes me feel like shit. <strong>If that&rsquo;s what they wanted,
congratulations to them.</strong> I feel like I&rsquo;m not entitled for help and by doing that
would expose me to evil people that would exploit me and get away from it because
they&rsquo;re a &ldquo;minority&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I have different visions about how to make life and society better and end most
social pathologies, but with this kind of behaviour I see at college, friends and
social media, it makes me feel hopeless, like I&rsquo;m not entitled to talk about it because
&ldquo;you&rsquo;re not them, so you can&rsquo;t speak on behalf of them&rdquo; and &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t interfere with the
life of others, we live like we want!&rdquo;, but then proceeds to dictate how a group
of people should behave, otherwise it&rsquo;s &ldquo;opression&rdquo;, even for the same group of
people they say they&rsquo;re defending against the opressors. I&rsquo;m not denying <strong>legitimate
opression</strong>, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean we should take sides too early in case of a
crisis because one side is more opressed than the other, but to proceed to think
and rationalize a solution to the problem instead of just fighting.</p>
<p>Listen, I don&rsquo;t want to make anyone feel bad. I&rsquo;m feeling bad at this very moment,
and I don&rsquo;t want anyone to be passing what I&rsquo;m feeling right now. But I&rsquo;m tired
from anyone cutting bonds with anyone that disagrees from him, and goes as far as
gaslighting them and getting people cancelled because of something stupid like a
opinion. People that pretend to be weak do a lot of work behind the scene against
those that disagree with them are either evil or really needs to seek professional
help. I don&rsquo;t have any empathy with them and I hope that your acts have serious
consequences in their lives.</p>
<p>I legitimately feel fear for someone falsely accusing me of something and then
proceed to exploit the system for their own gain. That happened to me before,
and I don&rsquo;t want to feel that again. That&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t want to talk and expose
a lot of myself to other people. <strong>I fear them, even my friends I have fear.</strong></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know for how long I will be feeling like this, but I hope it ends as soon
as possible.</p>
