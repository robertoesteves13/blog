<p>This is going to be my first time where I can talk about a bit of what I most
enjoy doing in my day-to-day basis. I&rsquo;ve been reading other people&rsquo;s blogs and
articles for a long time and I always had a will that one day I&rsquo;ll try to share
what I&rsquo;ve been discovering and studying. I took inspiration from
<a href="https://drewdevault.com/">Drew DeVault&rsquo;s blog</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an IT student located in Brazil that likes software development, especially
systems development. It&rsquo;s very possible that I will mostly talk about free and
open source software since I believe it&rsquo;s beneficial to everyone that uses
software, compared to other types that restrain their users freedom for the
sake of profits.</p>
<p>There are a lot of things I will talk about in this blog:</p>
<ul>
<li>Software development in *nix systems</li>
<li>Systems programming in Go, C and Zig</li>
<li>Idioms and Cultures (especially Brazillian and Finnish)</li>
<li>My vision about the world</li>
<li>Future events that I might participate</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks a lot for reading this, and I hope you&rsquo;re just as excited as me to see
what&rsquo;s this blog will be in the future!</p>
