      <title>In Defense of the Individual</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/in-defense-of-the-individual/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For a lot of people in society, individualism is seen as egoism and selfish,
the root of the evil that enslaves the less fortunate ones to the most powerful
of society, a form to justify actions that prejudice others. Because of this
negative view of action for oneself, we must &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt; ourselves from greed and serve
our society for the better of all. This thought can be traced back to Plato,
when he formed his metaphysics and epistemology, as he elaborates on his theory
of forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In sum, Plato says there are two world: the material world, a world that&amp;rsquo;s not
real and imperfect of thoughts, and the world of thoughts, a mystic and immaterial
world where it has the perfect forms but we cannot sense
it. He develops his theory by saying that all humans in the material form are
imperfect because we are in a &amp;ldquo;fake&amp;rdquo; world, whereas in the &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; world (the Form of Good),
we have the idea of the perfect human. As Leonard Peikoff explains plato on his
fantastic book:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to grasp this crucial principle, Plato continues — and here one can begin to
see the relevance of epistemology to politics — the mind is inadequate. The Form of
the Good cannot be known by the use of reason; it cannot be reached by a process
of logic; it transcends human concepts and human language; it cannot be defined,
described, or discussed. It can be grasped, after years of an ascetic preparation,
only by an ineffable mystic experience — a kind of sudden, incommunicable revelation
or intuition, which is reserved to the philosophical elite. The mass of men, by
contrast, are entangled in the personal concerns of this life. They are enslaved
to the lower world revealed to them by their senses. They are incapable of achieving
mystic contact with a supernatural principle. They are fit only to obey orders.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because we on the material world are inperfect, we should abandon individualism
and embrace a &amp;ldquo;organic theory of the state&amp;rdquo;, where the individual is viewed as a
cell to form an complete organism, the State. Plato elabores more on it on his theory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The first and highest form of the state and of the government and of the law,”
Plato writes, is a condition in which the private and individual is altogether
banished from life, and things which are by nature private, such as eyes and ears
and hands, have become common, and in some way see and hear and act in common, and
all men express praise and blame and feel joy and sorrow on the same occasions,
and whatever laws there are unite the city to the utmost.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref1:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we can cleary see that Plato advocates for the end of the individual and the
start of a totalitarian State. The school of thought that represents society as
a group is called collectivism. You can see it being applied on some dichotomies,
such as the race war, patriarchy, the classes struggle, any two groups that can
be labeled as the opressor and the opressed. This is a bunch of bullshit,
and I want to refute those arguments made by collectivies whose are making human
life more miserable for everyone. But first, let&amp;rsquo;s first introduce it on what
it is to be individualist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-is-the-individual&#34;&gt;What is the individual&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The individual is the oneself, a unique person that doesn&amp;rsquo;t have equal counterparts.
Despite the similarities one can have with another, they will always have something
that can differentiate them with others, such as name, age, sex, profession, hobbies,
life experience, family, religion, beliefs, knowledge, wealth, the list goes on &lt;em&gt;ad
infinitum&lt;/em&gt;. Although we could make an empirical analysis to find similarities
between individuals and classify them as groups, they will never be equal. It is
impossible to find a mirror-perfect version of yourself because that would mean they
lived the same life as you live, and no other person can live the very &lt;em&gt;single&lt;/em&gt; moment,
occupying the &lt;em&gt;exact&lt;/em&gt; space of another. &lt;strong&gt;Two bodies cannot occupy the same space at
the same time!&lt;/strong&gt; With that, by applying logic and reason, we can conclude that no
individual is equal to another, but rather different by natural law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This simple reasoning already disproves &lt;strong&gt;ALL&lt;/strong&gt; theories of intersectionality and
identity politics. They want to tell how hard or easy is &lt;strong&gt;YOUR&lt;/strong&gt; life based on their
incomplete observation, because all of they care is if you identify as a group,
&lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; as an individual. Because of their &lt;strong&gt;FLAWED AND INCOMPLETE&lt;/strong&gt; observations, they
want to &lt;strong&gt;BLAME&lt;/strong&gt; people because of a group characteristic and &lt;strong&gt;DEMAND&lt;/strong&gt; social reparations
by incorporating programs such as DEI. Do you know what also blames an individual
based on a characteristic of a group? &lt;strong&gt;Racism, xenophobia, homophobia,
transphobia, sexism, ageism, ableism, ethnocentrism, the list goes on and on!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These horrible things are the same type of judgement that people that says to
promote diversity do: &lt;strong&gt;collective guilt&lt;/strong&gt;. It is only ethical to judge a person
by the actions of the individual, not because they &lt;strong&gt;ARE&lt;/strong&gt; on said group.
Some of them admits that this is indeed discrimination, but they claim it to be positive
so we can have social justice. This is also wrong, because of the problem of intersectionality
explained above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So please, unless they can certainly &lt;strong&gt;TELL&lt;/strong&gt; what I&amp;rsquo;ll eat on lunch in the next
month, their social studies and &lt;em&gt;academic consensus&lt;/em&gt; is complete and utter BS.
Their analysis is as flat as a board, and no empirical analysis will &lt;strong&gt;EVER&lt;/strong&gt;
defy reasoning and logic. &lt;strong&gt;I DARE YOU TRY TO PROVE THAT 2+2=5 WITH STATISTICS&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;ok, my bad, I&amp;rsquo;ll try to be reasonable from now on. My nerves really kicks
in when I see people imposing their irrational judgement on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;ok-so-what-is-the-real-solution-to-these-problems&#34;&gt;Ok, so what is the real solution to these problems?&lt;/h1&gt;

      <title>Pushing Through Fear</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/pushing-through-fear/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 05 Aug 2024 13:17:03 -0300</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/pushing-through-fear/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve found out how to push through fear: objectivism, reason and logic
against mysticism and instincts. I&amp;rsquo;ll write a post about it in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve recently experienced severe symptons of anxiety, mainly because of several
bad events happening in my life sequentially. This not only had physical side
effects such as fast heartrates, shaking and insomia, but mental effects like
remembering traumas I&amp;rsquo;ve had many years ago in my life. This is a very tough
situation to be in, because for many days I required constant attention from my
friends and family and requiring constant help all the time so I don&amp;rsquo;t fall into
insanity and hurt others emotionally even more. This have backfired and almost
made things worse for them, in which I want to apologize for my behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fear is a very complex feeling that made a lot of things in life not enjoyable
for a long time. For me, it made socializing an almost impossible task to handle
if I genuinely like the person because of years of gaslisghtining that others
made me believe in and transcended from rational into instinct. It&amp;rsquo;s like when
you touch something very hot and your body reacts at almost instant speed without
the need to perceive in your head rationally. That&amp;rsquo;s why overcoming fears can
be as you need to endure the burning pain from something very hot and hold
still, ignoring all your body&amp;rsquo;s instict to try and cool it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite pain being very uncomfortable, it has a very important role. As we
live, we need to learn what&amp;rsquo;s threatens our lives and avoid us for hurting
ourselves in the future. It&amp;rsquo;s a unique characteristic where you can&amp;rsquo;t find on
bugs, since they have a way shorter lifespan than other species of animals.
Fear is also a mechanism to defend ourselves from threat, and it&amp;rsquo;s really good
to have when you have the desire to preserve your life in dangerous situations,
like falling from a very high point where it would be lethal. That&amp;rsquo;s why the
environment where you like affects a lot how you&amp;rsquo;re going to live life afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite fear having a reason to exist, you can always learn wrong things. And
when you learn something at the subconscious level, it&amp;rsquo;s really hard to get you
off. I&amp;rsquo;ve basically learned from wrong people that &lt;em&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m boring, annoying, have
nothing interesting to offer and shoudn&amp;rsquo;t bother trying to talk to anyone
because it would just waste their time since nobody likes me.&lt;/em&gt; I even remember
the exact time when someone tried to insult me in my back, but haven&amp;rsquo;t noticed
I was in the same room as she was, and I haven&amp;rsquo;t done anything bad to them, only
that I was &amp;ldquo;annoying&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This completely shatters my emotional life. For a long time, I could no longer
feel interested in someone without the fear of being hurt and made me develop
personalities that I wish I could get rid of them. I always have been driven by
the people that had an interest in me, and while this is not generally a bad
thing, a good portion of them had bad intentions or personalities that I really
dislike, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get rid of them because I would basically be alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This have always driven my life&amp;hellip;&lt;br&gt;
until certain day I tried to overcome it on a lonely day&amp;hellip;&lt;br&gt;
and met one of the best friends I ever had.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time, I made a friend because of my own and haven&amp;rsquo;t dependend on
anyone else. We have common interests and shared moments in our lives that we
felt pleasure. Developed a strong bond and affection with each other. &lt;em&gt;It was the
first time I felt I could do things for my own will&lt;/em&gt;. This also made me know
more people that are also as amazing, and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t feel more grateful for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No betrayal, no hate, but just love. A brotherly love, so to speak ☺️.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This made me realized that I have to do my best to push through this fear to
have someone in my life that I really like, and after many years of learning,
I&amp;rsquo;ve come to a point to understand what love means for a friendship, something
that gives a lot of pleasure and a meaning to many questions without a clear answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent months, this fear came back, with other ones that I didn&amp;rsquo;t cover here
cause it would be too long. I&amp;rsquo;m both thankful that I have such good friend to
help me and sorry for bothering them for a lot of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;read-this-if-you-have-identified-as-me&#34;&gt;Read this if you have identified as me&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite everything you have experienced, there are nice people in the world. Getting
reluctant about befriending someone won&amp;rsquo;t help you. You need to push through fear,
just like you need to endure pain. This is not a easy task, it requires a lot of
prepare, support and love to get through and achieve the things you want. Get
professional help if you are able to, despite having friends. Although friends
can mean something very precious to life and they could help you, they aren&amp;rsquo;t
prepared to handle your problems and you can actually hurt them if you try to insist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not 100% fine, but I&amp;rsquo;m way better than what I was compared to the past days.
I learned a lot from my friends and taking care of myself and coming more prepared
when something like this happens again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, I want to thank my dearest friends for giving me all the support and love
on these rough days. I&amp;rsquo;m getting better and soon I will be normal and enjoy more
moments together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re lonely, there will always be someone that will like you.
You just didn&amp;rsquo;t found it yet, and I hope that comes as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Muista Development 1</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/muista-development-1/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2024 16:17:48 -0300</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/muista-development-1/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long time no see! I have been busy with things in life, but things started to
get in order now. After reviewing all the progress that I&amp;rsquo;ve made with muista,
I decided to scrap everything because I noticed one thing&amp;hellip; &lt;strong&gt;my thought process
was flawed!&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, I always try to start a new project by jumping straight to programming.
But this project has something different from the &amp;ldquo;toy examples&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;ve made to
learn some technology. I want to make a &lt;em&gt;product&lt;/em&gt;, a &lt;em&gt;FOSS product&lt;/em&gt; to be precise,
and I want it to be very good at its objective. Analyse the following phrase:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muista is a program for structuring a well-defined language course with
rich-text support focused in immersive learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you see this, it might be a simple thing to program and should not take too
much time. But I missed to ask a question about something really crucial in
software development when you want to make something really good&amp;hellip; &lt;strong&gt;how are you using it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who doesn&amp;rsquo;t know, immersive learning is the proccess of learning a
language by absorbing the content of some media in their language. For example,
let&amp;rsquo;s say you like cooking and you want to learn finnish. One of the most effective
way to learn is to look for a recipe for ruisleipä (rye bread), look for keywords
and try to memorize them. You&amp;rsquo;ll start to notice that these keywords repeats
a lot on texts of the same topic, thus understanding the media you&amp;rsquo;re consuming
becomes easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;realization&#34;&gt;Realization&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I asked the usability question, a lot of ideas came into my mind, and my head started
to spin in circles! I have so many good ideas that I want to implement, but they
are so much my mind started to explode! When I started to feel this way, my decision
was to postpone this project until I get more technical experience to make it true,
but this wasn&amp;rsquo;t the thing I was lacking at&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything started when I took software engineering at college. In my mind, it was
going to be boring and would have a lot of whiteboard masturbation.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; But then
I noticed some important tool to organize my mind and focus on what&amp;rsquo;s the most important&amp;hellip; &lt;strong&gt;use cases!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a tool for listing what the user needs on a system and a description on how it
will work. You generally extract them by what the user is telling their needs and
categorize them in order of importance and ease of development. In my case, the user
is myself, so I prepared the text and started to separate each use case based on
what I&amp;rsquo;ve written. It resulted in 27 use cases for now, but I think it will have
more when I start to plan it more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;re done, you start doing the first task that&amp;rsquo;s the most important to
develop and the hardest one, the reason being to minimize risk already at the start.
It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if it depends on another use case to be done in pesperctive of
software usability, because we don&amp;rsquo;t want to use the system &lt;em&gt;yet&lt;/em&gt;. We just want
to see if the hardest thing to program is actually possible and try to avoid
frustration at the start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;devlog&#34;&gt;Devlog&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There wasn&amp;rsquo;t so much development in code, but I took one day to separate the use
cases and categorize them. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to spend time on UI, but on actual BLL code.
I still fear how to use this tool efficiently, because I don&amp;rsquo;t want to make something
to use as a library, but when integrating with the presentation layer it&amp;rsquo;s a disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t want to go full OOP style with crazy UMLs and event diagrams everywhere.
I&amp;rsquo;m using this tool solely for sorting my mind and prioritize on important things,
since I praise more on data-oriented design than notebook object-oriented programming,
but I believe in big companies this will be the norm since OOP is predominant in the
industry and not inherently bad, but I would say it&amp;rsquo;s misused in some cases (inheritance,
for example).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I listed all the use cases, something became very clear. An system inside the
program crucial for the user, something so important it would be game changer in the
world of language-learning software, &lt;strong&gt;a dictionary!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, it&amp;rsquo;s not an ordinary one, but something specifically crafted for learners.
There will be a lot of use cases that will be using it, and will be responsible for
almost all functionalities that the program will have. Some of its features will
include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See word definition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See categories for the word definition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See relations with other words&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will also be used to track word expertise and give hints on how to improve
familiarity for related words, seeking a saner way find out what&amp;rsquo;s important to
memorize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;final-thoughts&#34;&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next post, I will share a dictionary implementation specifically for language
learning. I will probably add more things but this is already a good start!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a term when something is overplanned for the sake of it, and have littl
pragmatic vision on the things proposed. I&amp;rsquo;m a not a kink, please&amp;hellip;&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>I think I&#39;m not fine</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/social-anxiety/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 14 Sep 2023 15:22:16 -0300</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/social-anxiety/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve refined my thoughts and now I have way better responses in what
I think. Although this post isn&amp;rsquo;t necessairly wrong, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t explains well
what the problems are, which I want to do in another post talking about
individualism, its misconceptions and how it would help to achieve a better society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mental health have been deteriorating over these months and I&amp;rsquo;m worried that
it&amp;rsquo;s getting worse. I can&amp;rsquo;t help but observe the absurds I see during my day and
how radicalized the world have become. I genuenily fear those people that mock
others because their views and beliefs are different than theirs, going as far
as gaslighting the person entirely. I&amp;rsquo;m no innocent for doing that at some point
of my life, but I try to redeem myself and start to have a better construction
of words where someone don&amp;rsquo;t be harrased by me and have a more civil discussion
about important things that are generally disregarded because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t match
their views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those super skeptical people that might think I may be on a extremist group
of some kind, I want to warn that &lt;strong&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m only speaking on behalf of myself, and not
for some group of any kind.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;everyone-needs-help-not-just-a-selective-minority-group-of-people&#34;&gt;Everyone needs help, not just a selective &amp;ldquo;minority&amp;rdquo; group of people.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s important to say it out loud, because some people just don&amp;rsquo;t get that
everyone have problems in their lives. Just because someone is a &amp;ldquo;cisgendered
white male&amp;rdquo;, doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that he can&amp;rsquo;t have any form of physical or emotional
support. Judging a person solely because of their appearence is just wrong, and
it creates a flammable debate about &lt;em&gt;why group X is the root of all evil in this
world&lt;/em&gt; that in turn radicalize individuals and distance them from each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, despite being considered a &amp;ldquo;cinsgendered white male&amp;rdquo;, I still have my
struggles. I have severe ADHD that makes learning very hard for me. Paying attention
for a consecutive amount of time is hard and any distractions makes me deviate from
what I need to do for hours. I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning how to better control it since
the pandemic, but sometimes I can&amp;rsquo;t just help myself. I really try, but it&amp;rsquo;s just
not enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite all my struggles, I&amp;rsquo;m happy on what I achieved to learn about programming
and computer science in general. I really love computers and I try to push it for
being my source of living in the future. I&amp;rsquo;m also grateful for having proper conditions
to live a life with dignity and so much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;but-i-cant-feel-any-good&#34;&gt;But I can&amp;rsquo;t feel any good&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still feel my life is miserable. I can&amp;rsquo;t see myself on the goals I try to push
and say for my friends and family. I can&amp;rsquo;t feel joy for doing things that I would
enjoy months ago. My only desire I have after work is going to bed and try to sleep,
but failing miserably because I still keep using my cellphone. I would even skip
some classes at college for that. I would even try to oversleep to not go at work,
but I know I&amp;rsquo;m needed there and also I need to do something at least productive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-plans-doesnt-go-as-expected&#34;&gt;My plans doesn&amp;rsquo;t go as expected&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I planned from moving to another place have been delayed because of college, which
seems fine at the start but I can&amp;rsquo;t see any importance of it anymore. My class has
a lot of people that brings unorder and chaos. They don&amp;rsquo;t care about learning and
the content, but about partying and using drugs, just like any university student
nowadays. Having a 18-22 year gap from others is a lot for zoomers, like I can&amp;rsquo;t
even understand some of the things they&amp;rsquo;re taking about. They seem to care more
about their social media life than real life itself. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be friends
to this kind of people, they care more about the physical part of life too much,
where I try to balance between the physical and spiritual/emotional parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;im-burned-out&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m burned out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t live my life like this anymore. I want a break from everything. I want to
rest for whatever amount of time I need to return with sanity. I want to feel joy
again like I have been feeling in the past months. &lt;strong&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t stay here doing nothing
to make my life a bit better and rot for years.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;rsquo;m also tired of trying. My persistance seems to have come to an end, for now, but it
also might be just a need to cool my mind off for some time. Still, I feel like I suck,
and those that attack people just by their appearence or believes affect me a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to believe in a world where I might be able to make a difference and also
a better place for everyone, but this agressive and radical dialogue about the
opressor and the opressed makes me feel like shit. &lt;strong&gt;If that&amp;rsquo;s what they wanted,
congratulations to them.&lt;/strong&gt; I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m not entitled for help and by doing that
would expose me to evil people that would exploit me and get away from it because
they&amp;rsquo;re a &amp;ldquo;minority&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have different visions about how to make life and society better and end most
social pathologies, but with this kind of behaviour I see at college, friends and
social media, it makes me feel hopeless, like I&amp;rsquo;m not entitled to talk about it because
&amp;ldquo;you&amp;rsquo;re not them, so you can&amp;rsquo;t speak on behalf of them&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;you can&amp;rsquo;t interfere with the
life of others, we live like we want!&amp;rdquo;, but then proceeds to dictate how a group
of people should behave, otherwise it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;opression&amp;rdquo;, even for the same group of
people they say they&amp;rsquo;re defending against the opressors. I&amp;rsquo;m not denying &lt;strong&gt;legitimate
opression&lt;/strong&gt;, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean we should take sides too early in case of a
crisis because one side is more opressed than the other, but to proceed to think
and rationalize a solution to the problem instead of just fighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to make anyone feel bad. I&amp;rsquo;m feeling bad at this very moment,
and I don&amp;rsquo;t want anyone to be passing what I&amp;rsquo;m feeling right now. But I&amp;rsquo;m tired
from anyone cutting bonds with anyone that disagrees from him, and goes as far as
gaslighting them and getting people cancelled because of something stupid like a
opinion. People that pretend to be weak do a lot of work behind the scene against
those that disagree with them are either evil or really needs to seek professional
help. I don&amp;rsquo;t have any empathy with them and I hope that your acts have serious
consequences in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I legitimately feel fear for someone falsely accusing me of something and then
proceed to exploit the system for their own gain. That happened to me before,
and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to feel that again. That&amp;rsquo;s why I don&amp;rsquo;t want to talk and expose
a lot of myself to other people. &lt;strong&gt;I fear them, even my friends I have fear.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know for how long I will be feeling like this, but I hope it ends as soon
as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Muista Development - Part 0</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/muista-development-part-0/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 11 Jul 2023 14:20:15 -0300</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/muista-development-part-0/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning finnish since 3 years ago, starting with language learning apps
(specially the green owl one), Youtube videos and also TV shows from the country,
at which point I decided to get enrolled ina course where the embassy of Finland
in Brazil recommended (always send your questions to the local embassies of a
country that you have interested to learn their language, they are generally
receptive and tries their best to answer your questions!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I find very difficulty to get familiarity with words in the language,
despite getting exposure to them a lot of times. I tried to use anki, a really
good flashcard software used a lot to memorize new words of a language, but the
biggest flaw I believe is that you only memorize the word at it&amp;rsquo;s own, not the
meaning that it has on a certain text. That becomes a lot more obvious with sentences
like &lt;strong&gt;Kuusi Palaa&lt;/strong&gt;, that can mean:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The spruce is on fire&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The spruce returns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The number six is on fire&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The number six returns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Six of them are on fire&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Six of them return&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your moon is on fire&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your moon returns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Six pieces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s just a lot of things to memorize for a single sentence, and it&amp;rsquo;s not this
particular example! Finnish has a lot of single words with multiple meanings that
depends on the context. In short, using anki to learn languages isn&amp;rsquo;t very
effective for finnish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s why I had an idea, what if I create a program where the user can put any
text inside of it, then it can mark words that he wants to memorize (also annotating
other things like the normal form, type, etc&amp;hellip;) and later it has a quiz where
it shows the word, the additional annotations and the whole sentence where this
word was marked initially?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s why I want to create a new program called &lt;strong&gt;Muista&lt;/strong&gt;! I had a lot of attempts
of trying to create this type of program, but I always struggled to conform with
user experience, developer experience and what I believe it&amp;rsquo;s the best for the
desktop world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m opposed to the modern way to do desktop development, which are only an instance
of Chromium/Webkit running an HTML page with CSS and ECMAscript. It might be good
for UI and security, but it becomes a burden when you want to interact with the
underlying system below it. When I tried tauri, using something like SQLite was
painful because it made me code the same data model &lt;em&gt;twice&lt;/em&gt;, and the IPC communication
via tauri commands results in &lt;strong&gt;frequent Serialization/Deserialization of JSON&lt;/strong&gt;, making
the program much slower if you try to stream megabytes of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I also wanted to be cross-platform! So a lot of frameworks like GTK (yes, I
know you can use it on Windows and MacOS, but it leaves a lot to be desired on
these platforms), WPF and others aren&amp;rsquo;t suitable. After lots of time choosing,
I decided to use the same GUI library that anki also uses: &lt;strong&gt;Qt&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has good support on most operating systems, it&amp;rsquo;s very mature and have the performance I desire
for my program. A lot of people says it&amp;rsquo;s very bloated, but even it being a fair
criticsm, it&amp;rsquo;s what I also liked about it: it has SQL support and a lot of widgets
to make complex interfaces. I believe it&amp;rsquo;s going to be a good library to use for
this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a lot of work to do, specially designing and prototyping it, so in the next
days I&amp;rsquo;ll be focusing my time in development of this application. I hope you&amp;rsquo;re just
as excited as me :).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My First Post!</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/my-first-post/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;hello-world&#34;&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is going to be my first time where I can talk about a bit of what I most
enjoy doing in my day-to-day basis. I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading other people&amp;rsquo;s blogs and
articles for a long time and I always had a will that one day I&amp;rsquo;ll try to share
what I&amp;rsquo;ve been discovering and studying. I took inspiration from
&lt;a href=&#34;https://drewdevault.com/&#34;&gt;Drew DeVault&amp;rsquo;s blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m an IT student located in Brazil that likes software development, especially
systems development. It&amp;rsquo;s very possible that I will mostly talk about free and
open source software since I believe it&amp;rsquo;s beneficial to everyone that uses
software, compared to other types that restrain their users freedom for the
sake of profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of things I will talk about in this blog:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software development in *nix systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Systems programming in Go, C and Zig&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Idioms and Cultures (especially Brazillian and Finnish)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My vision about the world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Future events that I might participate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks a lot for reading this, and I hope you&amp;rsquo;re just as excited as me to see
what&amp;rsquo;s this blog will be in the future!&lt;/p&gt;
