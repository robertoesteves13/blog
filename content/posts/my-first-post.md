# Hello, world!

This is going to be my first time where I can talk about a bit of what I most
enjoy doing in my day-to-day basis. I've been reading other people's blogs and
articles for a long time and I always had a will that one day I'll try to share
what I've been discovering and studying. I took inspiration from
[Drew DeVault's blog](https://drewdevault.com/) 

I'm an IT student located in Brazil that likes software development, especially
systems development. It's very possible that I will mostly talk about free and
open source software since I believe it's beneficial to everyone that uses
software, compared to other types that restrain their users freedom for the
sake of profits.

There are a lot of things I will talk about in this blog:
- Software development in *nix systems
- Systems programming in Go, C and Zig
- Idioms and Cultures (especially Brazillian and Finnish)
- My vision about the world
- Future events that I might participate

Thanks a lot for reading this, and I hope you're just as excited as me to see
what's this blog will be in the future!
